# Welcome to my InventoryProject

![Preview](https://hprobertos.github.io/images/pic4.jpg)

This was a project made only by me, for a school project.
I used Visual Basic for FrontEnd and SQL Server for BackEnd.

I do not earn money from this and the only purpose of it was to complete the corresponding course.

## How to use
It´s a simulation of an inventory of a warehouse, where you can add items, delete, make a purchase and get a receipt. 

You have all rights to use it as you wish, but I will be so grateful if you credit me for my work.
